# CAS - Single Sign-On for the Web

CAS (Central Authentication Service) provides an enterprise single sign-on service with the following notable features:

* Java (Spring Webflow/MVC servlet) server component
* Support for multiple protocols (CAS, SAML, OAuth, OpenID)
* Cross-platform client support (Java, .Net, PHP, Perl, Apache, etc)
* Integrates with uPortal, BlueSocket, Moodle, and Google Apps to name a few

In addition to software, CAS provides a friendly open source community that actively supports and contributes to the project. While the project is rooted in higher-ed open source, it has grown to an international audience with a scope from Fortune 500 companies to small special-purpose installations.
